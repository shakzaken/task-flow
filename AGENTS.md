## Purpose

This document defines the preferred engineering conventions for this project. The goal is to keep the codebase consistent, simple, and easy to maintain.

## Python / FastAPI

### Architecture

* Use **Pydantic** for application models, request models, and response models.
* Use **object-oriented style** for **services** and **repositories**.
* Use **repositories** for interacting with the database.
* Use **services** for interacting with infrastructure components such as **cache** and **queues** (for example Redis or RabbitMQ), and for coordinating business flows when needed.
* Keep **FastAPI routes** as regular functions, not class-based routes.
* Use **async-first FastAPI design** unless a task explicitly states otherwise.
* Prefer **async libraries** for database, queue, HTTP, and storage integrations when building FastAPI services.
* Prefer `async def` for FastAPI route handlers, service methods, and repository methods that perform I/O.
* If a synchronous library must be used, document the reason clearly and keep the blocking boundary explicit.

### Recommended structure

* Keep route handlers thin.
* Use type hints everywhere.
* Put database access logic inside repositories.
* Do not put business logic in repositories.
* Put external system access logic inside services.
* Keep business logic out of route handlers as much as possible.
* Inject dependencies explicitly through FastAPI dependencies.

### Validation and schemas

* Use Pydantic models for validation at the API boundary.
* Keep request and response schemas explicit.
* Avoid passing raw dictionaries between layers when a typed model makes the contract clearer.

### Code style

* Prefer clear names over clever abstractions.
* Keep functions and methods focused on one responsibility.
* Avoid unnecessary inheritance.
* Prefer composition over deep class hierarchies.

### Environment and packaging

* Use **uv** as the Python package manager for Python services.
* Keep a separate Python environment per service.
* Use `api-service/.venv` for the API service and `worker-service/.venv` for the worker service.
* Keep Python dependencies scoped to each service's own `pyproject.toml`.
* Do not rely on a shared root Python virtual environment across services.

## React

* Use **Vite** as the frontend build tool.
* Use **TypeScript**.
* Prefer functional components.
* Keep components small and focused.
* Extract reusable UI logic into hooks only when it improves clarity.
* Avoid unnecessary global state.

---

## General principles

* **Do not over-engineer.**
* **Keep it simple.**
* Test every task that you do.
* Prefer readability over cleverness.
* Make the smallest reasonable change that solves the problem.
* Keep modules cohesive and easy to navigate.
* Avoid introducing new libraries unless there is a clear reason.
* Follow the existing project structure and naming conventions.
* Write code that is easy to debug and easy to remove if requirements change.
